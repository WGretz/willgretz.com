# About Me

I am a huge nerd. I moved to Portland in 2019 from Spokane, WA so that I could be closer to niche live music.  I recently bought a house in SE Portland and had my partner move down with me so my time has mostly been spent fixing up the house and getting settled in.

I've been making stuff for the web since I was in middle school.  It started out coding HTML and CSS for my myspace page or some roleplaying groups, and grew into making websites for friends and other fan sites.  When I got to college I decided I wanted to learn web development stuff so I could pay for a masters in Psychology, but when A guy from a later grade showed me DHH's 5 minute blog video it sparked something in me.  I began learning further ahead than even my teachers and was able to get a job in the web development field before I graduated.  I've been working as a web developer ever since.  I ultimately didn't get a degree because the degree was only going to transfer as elective credits if I wanted to get a bachelors and I wasn't interested in starting over.
